# functional-pharmacy

A pharmacy system that uses a functional database (Datomic)

## Rationale

  Well obviously we want all of the things mentioned [here](http://www.datomic.com/rationale.html)

  We're also doing this as part of a proof of concept that could very well ring in a new era of technologies at H-E-B.

  No longer will I sit by and watch good developers struggle with "traditional" databases that were developed when dedicated, expensive boxes were necessary and memory and storage was expensive.

  So functional-pharmacy is an exploration of what it's like not to have these constraints.

  We're going to assume that:
   - we have gigabytes of RAM
   - our network bandwith and speed matches or exceeds hard disk access
   - we can spin up and kill servers on a whim
